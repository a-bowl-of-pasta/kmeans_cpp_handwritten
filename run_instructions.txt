hello, this is a quick reference for running the program - just in case. 

---------------------------
if you want to run via the bat file, just use this command :: 

.\run_rand.bat <FILE_NAME.txt> <K_values> <iteration> <convergence> <num_of_runs>

make sure to replace all the <....> with their actual values

---------------------------
if you want to run via the cpp file itself, i included the path info. 
there are comments in my cpp main function that include : 
    * path for running via bat file
    * path for running via cpp file

if you run the cpp file instead of the bat, just make sure to uncomment them. 

---------------------------
everything else is pretty straight forward. 

- code_and_files has the cpp code and the input files
- output_files has the output_files
